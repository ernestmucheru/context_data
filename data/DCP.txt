1Disciplinary Code & Procedure Policy 
2.0 Introduction 
The objective of this Disciplinary Code and Procedure policy is to regulate discipline at  Cellulant with the key principle that the employer and the employee should treat each other  with mutual respect. 
Although discipline in general can be applied according to these provisions, it should be  noted that departure from these norms may be justified in proper circumstances. 
3.0 Scope 
This policy is applicable to all employees of Cellulant. 
4.0 Purpose  
The purpose is: 
∙ Primarily prevention or correction rather than punishment 
∙ To ensure the maintenance of satisfactory work performance and/or acceptable standards  ∙ of conduct of all employees; To ensure that employees are treated fairly and consistently and any disciplinary action is  effected for a fair reason and in accordance with a fair procedure; 
∙ To ensure that discipline is based on the philosophy of discouraging and/or correcting  unacceptable conduct and/or unsatisfactory performance and getting the employee  
involved in changing such conduct or performance. 
∙ To encourage the use of informal counselling and progressive disciplinary measures to  correct unsatisfactory job performance or misconduct. 
5.0 General Provisions 
∙ Cellulant has the right and a responsibility to manage its business and direct its  employees in doing so. 
∙ Cellulant reserves the right to implement rules or to establish standards of performance  and behaviour and the measurement thereof. 
∙ An employee has the right to be represented by a fellow employee at any stage of a  disciplinary procedure. 
∙ No incident or offence can be considered in isolation and the total impact of the offence  in a disciplinary action shall be considered. 
∙ Before a problem becomes a disciplinary issue, a supervisor may guide, inform or

remind the employee informally on the applicable rule or performance situation. Such  counselling is not viewed to form part of formal disciplinary action but is rather part of a  day-to-day communication within the company. 
∙ Formal procedures do not have to be invoked every time a rule is broken or standard is  not met. Informal advice and correction is accepted as the best and most effective way  for the company to deal with minor violations of work discipline. 
∙ Repeated misconduct warrants warnings, which themselves may be graded according to  degree of severity. More serious infringements or repeated misconduct may call for a  final warning or other action short of dismissal. Terminations and dismissals would be  reserved for cases of serious misconduct or repeated offences. 
∙ The seriousness of the offence will determine the action to be taken and not necessarily,  the number of occasions the transgressions was committed. 
∙ Employees who are subject to discipline by professional bodies are reminded that the  Cellulant has a duty to report any incidence to the appropriate body who may  investigate the case. Cases of gross professional misconduct will go through the  disciplinary process. 
∙ A disciplinary committee shall be convened where off duty offences lead to confinement  in police custody and is not within fourteen days either released on bail or on bond or  otherwise lawfully set at liberty.  
∙ Where the Disciplinary Code and Procedure contradicts the Employment Acts in the  countries of operation by Cellulant, the Employment Acts or legal precedence in the  respective countries shall supersede. 
6.0 Sanctions/Punitive Measures 
∙ Disciplinary steps can be taken only once the facts and the circumstances of the case  have been considered carefully. In the interests of consistency, the steps taken must be  clearly formulated, with reasons being provided for all actions as far as possible. 
∙ The sanctions proposed in Annexure 1 with regard to the offences listed are not  exhaustive in nature and merely serve as a guideline to managers and employees as to  what constitutes acceptable conduct and performance.  
∙ Any other action by an employee which threatens the relationship between employer  and employee, or between employees, can also be regarded as an offence in terms of this  disciplinary code.
3 Disciplinary Code & Procedure Policy  
The Issue Number: 01 Prepared by: Dorcas Kiai Sign: D.K Date: May 2016 Revision Status: 00 Approved by: Isabella Segina Sign: I.S Date: May 2016 
∙ The sanctions stated in the disciplinary code, are guidelines. The manager or chairperson  may impose stricter or more lenient measures depending on the circumstances; each case  is to be judged on its own merits. 
∙ Since it is impossible to put together a comprehensive list of all possible offences, the  Company reserves the right to take disciplinary action against any offence or  misconduct, irrespective of whether it is contained in this code. 
∙ Once an alleged charge against an employee has been proved and mitigating and  aggravating factors considered, a sanction must be imposed. The sanction must be  proportionate to the offence. It must be emphasised that the aim of disciplinary action is  to allow the employee to improve unacceptable conduct, and not simply to punish the  offender. It is the manager's responsibility to ensure that discipline is exercised and  applied correctly in order to achieve the desired result. 
∙ In some cases it may be advisable to link a punitive measure to some form of corrective  action. An example of this is where an employee has received a final written warning for  drunkenness, and together with the final written warning the manager insists that the  employee undergo therapy. 
7.0 Period of Validity of Warnings 
There are five forms of disciplinary sanctions which may be applied to remedy disciplinary  transgressions. These sanctions and their validity are contained in the table below: 
Disciplinary Sanction 
	Validity
	Written warning 
	12 months
	All others plus final written warning 
	12 months
	Dismissal with notice 
	N/A
	Dismissal without notice 
	N/A
	



8.0 Procedural And Substantive Fairness 
All disciplinary processes shall be substantively and procedurally fair. Substantive fairness  implies that there should be a valid and fair reason for the particular disciplinary action. A  fair procedure refers to the requirement that certain procedures be followed before a  sanction may be imposed on an employee.

9.0 Procedural Guidelines 
9.1 Having regard for the particular circumstances of each individual case, and  except where exceptional circumstances prevail; no employee shall be disciplined  without being afforded the opportunity of stating their case. 
9.2 Except in instances where the consistent sanction is a written warning, final  written warning or dismissal; formal disciplinary procedures do not have to be  invoked every time a standard of conduct or performance is breached. 9.3 Informal hearings and correction is often the best and most effective way to  deal with minor violations of conduct and performance standards. 
9.4 Where formal disciplinary procedures are initiated against an employee,  he/she shall have the following rights: 
∙ To be represented by a fellow employee of the Company at the disciplinary  hearing. The employee will be required to make the appropriate arrangements  for such representative to be available to assist at the disciplinary hearing; 
∙ To be notified in writing of the charge in advance of the disciplinary hearing,  thereby affording the employee and their representative an opportunity to  prepare for the disciplinary hearing; 
∙ To request an interpreter if the language used at the disciplinary hearing is not  their spoken proficient language or the employee is not proficient with the  language used at the disciplinary hearing. It is the duty of the Cellulant to  provide an interpreter should the employee request one; 
∙ To present their case by calling witnesses of their choice and if they so choose  then they can testify on their own behalf. It is the employee’s responsibility to  arrange for the attendance of such witnesses; 
∙ To hear and cross-examine witnesses called by the Cellulant; 
∙ To be notified in writing of the outcome of the disciplinary hearing; ∙ To be advised of his/ her right to refer the matter to appeal, if dissatisfied with  the outcome of the disciplinary hearing.

∙ This discussion should enable the Head of department to provide constructive feedback  and the employee to express views on the issue.  
∙ It is important for both parties to understand that informal action is not formal  disciplinary action and employees are not entitled to representation at this stage.  ∙ Where the need for improvement is identified, the supervisor should explain to the  employee what needs to be done and how the conduct will be reviewed in a given  period.  
∙ Although verbal, it is necessary to make a note for the employees file and if the  employee has given a mitigating statement, it should also be filed.  
13.0 Written warning 
∙ The head of department, in consultation with the human resources office and the,  initiates a written warning.  
∙ The written warning document to the staff member specifies:

15.0 Disciplinary in respect of poor work performance 
If the employer is of the view that an employee, whether on probation or a permanent  member of staff, is not performing in accordance with the job that the employee has been  appointed to do, the employer must:

∙ A suspension may not exceed thirty (30) calendar days.  
∙ A suspension shall be with pay and the suspension letter is issued by the human  resources department only.

The Issue Number: 01 Prepared by: Dorcas Kiai Sign: D.K Date: May 2016 Revision Status: 00 Approved by: Isabella Segina Sign: I.S Date: May 2016 
∙ Witnesses may be called by the Committee, both on behalf of the organisation and the  employee and may be questioned concerning any relevant evidence.

∙ When preparing for the hearing the employee should be informed that he/she is  allowed to bring a colleague to the meeting and if the employee declines, this should be  brought out in the notes. 
∙ The DC, having fully considered the circumstances of the case and conducting further  investigations where necessary will decide whether or not a disciplinary sanction is  justified.  
∙ For a disciplinary sanction to be justified in a situation where the facts of the case have  been in dispute and a full investigation has been conducted, there must be a reasonably  held belief on the grounds of probability, that the employee committed the act in  question.  
∙ The outcome of the disciplinary committee meeting shall be communicated to the  employee. 
∙ After reviewing all the evidence presented, including all written information provided  by the employee, the disciplinary committee will determine whether or not to take the  proposed disciplinary action.

∙ If an employee tenders a resignation prior to the implementation of the disciplinary  action, the employee's personnel record should show that the employee resigned.  ∙ However, if the disciplinary action process is already under way and the employee  decides to resign, documentation of the process must remain in the personnel file. ∙ If the decision is made to terminate or dismiss, the supervisor should give the staff  member a letter signed by the Head of Human Resource outlining the reason for the  termination or dismissal and the effective date of the termination or dismissal and the  employee shall sign receipt of the letter.

20.0 Termination 
∙ It is important to note that on completion of a disciplinary hearing at which an employee  has been terminated, the reasons for termination must be explained to the employee.  This must be done in writing. The employee must be reminded of his/her right to appeal to the Group CEO. The tapes/minutes of any disciplinary hearings at which the ruling  was made that the employee's service is terminated must be kept available and must  clearly state the nature of the disciplinary offences and the reasons for dismissal and  must be availed to the employee in the event that the employee needs them. 
∙ If the employee tenders his or her resignation pending the finalisation of a Disciplinary  Hearing, as a rule, Cellulant reserves the right to continue with the hearing until a  finding has been reached. 
21.0 Appeal Process 
Each employee shall have the right to appeal any decision of the Disciplinary committee to  the Group CEO;  
a) Such appeal shall be done in writing within ten (10) days from the receipt of the decision  of the Disciplinary Committee.  
b) An Appeal Hearing may or may not be a re-hearing of the case depending on the  circumstances of the case.  
c) The employee must be specific about the grounds of appeal based on issues that he/she  feels were not adequately addressed by the Disciplinary Committee.  
d) The employee shall not be entitled to introduce or lodge an appeal based on new  evidence or material which they did not adduce during the Disciplinary Committee  hearing unless they can substantially justify to the committee the reason for such failure. 
The appeals committee shall only consider appeals on the following grounds of: a. Procedure - a failure to follow procedure had a material effect on the decision;  b. Decision - the evidence did not support the conclusion reached or is inconsistent with  other decisions within the organization. 
c. New evidence - which has genuinely come to light since the first hearing. Where new  evidence is raised, further investigations may need to be carried out which may require  the Appeal Hearing to be delayed pending the outcome of these investigations and to  give the employee an opportunity to consider any new information obtained.

The Issue Number: 01 Prepared by: Dorcas Kiai Sign: D.K Date: May 2016 Revision Status: 00 Approved by: Isabella Segina Sign: I.S Date: May 2016 
∙ The appeal hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the general principles and  timelines set out. In particular, during the appeal hearing, the employee must present  his/her case, stating the nature and grounds for their appeal, and lead evidence or  argument in this regard. The employee shall have the right to state or have his/her  representative state their case and to call witnesses. Cellulant shall then have the  opportunity to state its case and call and cross-examine witnesses. 
∙ The Group CEO or nominated Appeals Chairperson shall then determine the merits of  the employee’s appeal and document his/her decision in writing to the employee. 
∙ The Group CEO or Committee shall communicate the final decision and that decision  shall be extended to the employee. 
22.0 Responsibility
